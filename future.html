                The world is in the midst of a technological revolution, with almost anything we could conceive of as a
                need easily available. We have robots vacuuming our floors and mowing our lawns, cars will soon drive
                themselves, and smart homes can get dinner cooking, or turn the lights on from a remote location. All of
                these conveniences take energy, the source of which is a matter of debate.
            </p>
            <p>
                And while our demand for energy is growing, so too is our pressure on the national grid, and our impact
                on the climate. Over the last 30 years, New Zealander’s have increased their annual energy consumption
                by around 150 PJ (or Petajoules). Just 1 petajoule has enough energy to drive 30,000 cars for a whole
                year, so the picture of a massive increase in demand is clear. Because that demand comes mostly from
                vehicles (our cars, industrial vehicles, planes, and so on), our reliance on fossil fuels currently
                remains high.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is forecasted that by 2050, our electricity demand will increase by 82% (off a 2013 baseline). As
                electric vehicles replace their petrol-driven counterparts, pressure on our energy production will
                increase significantly. If we also consider climate change and the inconsistency it can bring to our
                ability to produce a consistent energy supply, New Zealand must undertake some urgent planning.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of today, the most economically viable forms of new renewable electricity generation are most likely
                to be wind and solar energy. We already see solar on our own houses at a small scale, and have heard of
                large-scale wind farms producing hundreds of megawatts. Being able to make use of this power generation
                around the clock through the use of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi-enabled appliances is a first step in building
                supply resilience, as is the more widespread use of batteries for storage.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, it is time to have some serious discussions about how to make New Zealand’s power generation
                future-proof: affordable, sustainable, and reliable. Are we currently dabbling around the edges of a
                large infrastructure issue, or can we be ready for the future? Is it time to start having a conversation
                about the introduction of nuclear energy so that supply can be close to the highest demand, enabling us
                to avoid transmission losses? Whatever it will take, I am sure that we can be successful if we
                collaborate with a vision of a clean, green, secure, and cost-effective future in mind.
