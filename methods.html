                The total generation by different methods is available for a considerable length of time. This data is
                shown in the graph below, and you can see that over the past 50 years, hydroelectric power has been by
                far the biggest power generation method in New Zealand.

                    Hydroelectric power is generated by converting water's gravitational potential energy into kinetic
                    energy, which is then used to spin turbine blades which cause a generator to spin. Essentially,
                    almost all motion-based electricity generation uses a similar approach. A generator works by moving
                    a magnet inside a of some wires. The magnetic field lines cause a current to be created in the wires
                    - this is electricity. So things like wind turbines and steam turbines and even geothermal plants
                    use kinetic energy to spin turbine blades, which cause a generator to spin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of hydroelectric power, the energy the water has is given to it by the distance it falls
                    before it reached the turbine. This means you need a considerable drop to generate a lot of
                    electricity. The photo of Karapiro dam here shows that the water falls some 20m before it reached
                    the turbine. Water is quite heavy, so that's enough of a fall to build up considerable momentum
                    which is then turned into power!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, it also means that you can't just dam any creek and generate electricity from it.
                    Well, lots of electricity, anyway. You need a considerable drop in elevation to give the water some
                    oomph! That's why the Karapiro power station is the last one on the Waikato river. The river
                    actually only falls another meter or so after Karapiro before it gets to the sea. There's no place
                    suitable for a power station for the entire rest of the river.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's worse is that there are very few rivers left that are able to be dammed to produce more
                    hydroelectric power. We need to find a new way of generating more power!

                <p>
                    Geothermal energy uses the heat trapped underground to produce power. New Zealand is positioned on
                    the Pacific Ring of Fire, a boundary between tectonic plates where volcanic activity and earthquakes
                    are common. This means that super hot magma is close to the surface in some places, perfect for
                    heating water and turning it into steam. We can drill down to find this super hot steam, and pipe it
                    up to the surface where we can pass it through steam turbines and use that to generate electricity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As you can see from the graph at the top of the page, New Zealand has brought on more geotherman
                    generation over the past 50 years, and now it is the second biggest source of electricity generation
                    in the country. Geothermal plants are very expensive, though, and they have to be located near areas
                    with known geothermal activity to minimize the drilling depth (and therefore reduce costs). This
                    means there's a limit to how much new geothermal generation we can build.

                <p>
                    Huntly Power Station is New Zealand's biggest coal and gas-fired power plant. This type of plant is
                    called a thermal power plant, because it uses fuel to heat water to turn it into steam. Unlike
                    geothermal energy, which uses the earth's heat, buring coal and gas produces a lot of carbon
                    emissions. These are contributors to climate change, and so you can see that the share of coal and
                    gas power has steadily dropped over the past 50 years.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Huntly contributes some 50% of New Zealand's power generation carbon emissions when it runs! It has
                    quite a large generation capacity, originally built to provide a GWh of power with its 4 boilers,
                    and is placed close to Auckland to provide for its growing power needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it still runs on occasion, it has had some boilers decommissioned and because it produces so
                    much greenhous gases it is mainly used when there is no other generation available. Huntly was built
                    to run on gas or coal, unlike many older coal-only plants, and the coal has to be crushed into a
                    find dust and injected into the boilers like a gas when it is used. There are vast coal fields in
                    the Waikato near the power plant, making it quite cheap to run when it was first built.

                <p>
                    Wind power is a steadily increasing source of electricity. Wind turbines can be put in exposed
                    places to draw power from the movement of air. Ones like in the photo are very large, so that they
                    can get the most out of air currents. Their blades are made of carbon fibre to be incredibly light
                    and strong, and they can take advantage of even light breezes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some complaints about wind power include the effects they have on the scenery, on birdlife and the
                    noise they make which some people describe as a constant low-frequency noise that disturbs nearby
                    homes, especially at night. Effects on bird life may be the worst of this, but studies so far have
                    been inconclusive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More recent designs of wind turbines include vertical axis ones that can be placed near buildings.
                    These turbines are supposed to be safer for wildlife and will also produce less low frequency sound
                    as they spin much faster. This might provide more options for placing turbines near cities, closer
                    to where the electricity they generate is used.

                <p>
                    Solar Photovoltaic, or PV, is probably the electricity source people see most often. Solar panels
                    work differently to the other methods mentioned. Sunlight falling on PV panels produces electricity
                    directly, without converting the energy into another form first. The light rays cause electrons to
                    gain enough energy to break free of their atoms, which causes an electric current to flow. This
                    amazing technology produces power passively whenever the sun shines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the overall power production of a given space is quite low, compared to using that space for a
                    coal plant or hydro dam, Solar PV has a massive advantage of being able to be placed on houses and
                    other buildings. The panels are flat, so ideal for putting on roofs or the sides of buildings that
                    get sun, and using that otherwise wasted area to produce power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some disadvantages of solar PV are that it is relatively expensive per megawatt hour of electricity,
                    compared to other forms of mass generation. The energy must be stored, requiring batteries and an
                    inverter, as it only produces power during the day. The PV panels also have an environmental impact
                    when they are produced, which means they're not quite as good for the environment as they seem.
                    However, the ability to produce power from an otherwise wasted space means that they are an
                    excellent way for individual households to produce their own electricity and longer term, they will
                    reduce the amount of generation that New Zealand needs to add. This makes them a super interesting
                    option for the future.
