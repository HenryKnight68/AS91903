                When it comes to electricity, it seems at first there is just one need - to keep the lights on and
                produce enough electricity for everyone that needs it. But it doesn’t take much thinking to work out
                that there’s more to it than that. Producing the right amount of electricity for demand is complicated,
                and as demand grows, our problem becomes bigger to solve.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem of electricity generation is three-fold. How can we achieve reliability, sustainability and
                affordability all at the same time? And in a world where the demand for electricity is increasing
                exponentially, how do we plan effectively for the future?
            </p>
            <p>
                Data from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) reveals that 60% of New Zealand’s
                electricity in 2023 was generated through hydropower, 18% through geothermal, 9% through gas, 7% through
                wind, and just over 2% from coal. Significantly, the Huntly power station, which provides electricity to
                much of Auckland, Northland, and Waikato, as well as acting as a backup in periods of low hydro
                generation, uses coal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the next 25 years, New Zealand is committed to increasing its share of renewable energy to 98.3%,
                even with the predicted increase in demand. That translates to up to 71.7 terawatt-hours (TW) per year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Affordability is another significant concern for New Zealanders regarding electricity generation. Dry
                summers driven by climate change have caused the hydro lake levels to drop, and combined with the lower
                than normal levels of rainfall and falling gas reserves, the price of electricity has exploded. Since
                September 2021, wholesale electricity prices have risen from approximately $100 per megawatt hour (MWh)
                to an average of $700 per MWH in August 2024.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the likelihood of the hydro lakes remaining low, and without finding further gas reserves, New
                Zealand will have an ongoing problem with affordability and reliability. Electricity heavy industries
                will have to charge more for their products and agree to more cuts when supply is low, meaning the New
                Zealand economy will be at risk. It also means there will be less opportunities to open our country to
                large data farms, and industry that is profitable, but requires the electricity to be affordable and
                reliable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, New Zealand needs to grow its electricity supply, especially with renewable energy sources.
